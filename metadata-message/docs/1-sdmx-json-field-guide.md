# Introduction to SDMX-JSON Metadata Message

See the SDMX-JSON Data Message docs for a brief introduction of the SDMX information model. For additional information on the SDMX information model, please refer to the [SDMX documentation](http://sdmx.org/?page_id=10).

Samples, tools and other SDMX-JSON resources are available in the public Github repository <https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-json>.

Before we start, let's clarify a few more things about this guide:

- New fields may be introduced in later versions. Therefore consuming applications should tolerate the addition of new fields with ease.
- The ordering of properties in objects is undefined. The properties may appear in any order and consuming applications should not rely on any specific ordering. It is safe to consider a nulled property and the absence of a property as the same thing.
- Not all properties appear in all contexts. For example response with error messages may not contain a data property.

# Field Guide to SDMX-JSON Metadata Message Objects

## message

Message is the top level object and it contains the requested information (referential metadata) as well as the meta-information decribing the (technical) context of the message and, possibly, error information.

* meta - *Object* *optional*. A *[meta](#meta)* object that contains non-standard meta-information and basic technical information about the message, such as when it was prepared and who has sent it.
* data - *Object* *optional*. *[Data](#data)* contains the message's “primary data”.
* errors - *Array* *optional*. *Errors* field is an array of *[error](#error)* objects. When appropriate provides a list of error messages in addition to RESTful web services HTTP error status codes.

The members data and errors MUST NOT coexist in the same message.

Example:

	{
		"meta": {
			# meta object #
		},
		"data": {
			# data object #
		},
		"errors": [
			{
				# error object #
			}
		]
	}

## meta

*Object* *optional*. Used to include non-standard meta-information and basic technical information 
about the message, such as when it was prepared and who has sent it.
Any members MAY be specified within `meta` objects.
* schema - *String* *optional*. Contains the URL to the schema allowing to validate the message. This also allows identifying the version of SDMX-JSON format used in this message. **Providing the link to the SDMX-JSON schema is recommended.**
* id - *String*. Unique string that identifies the message for further references.
* test - *Boolean* *optional*. Indicates whether the message is for test purposes or not. False for normal messages.
* prepared - *String*. A timestamp indicating when the message was prepared. Values must follow the ISO 8601 syntax for combined dates and times, including time zone.
* content-languages - *Array* *optional*. Array of strings containing the identifyer of all languages used anywhere in the message for localized elements, and thus the languages of the intended audience, representaing in an array format the same information than the http Content-Language response header, e.g. "en, fr-fr". See IETF Language Tags: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1. The array's first element indicates the main language used in the message for localized elements. **The usage of this property is recommended.** Consult the section on [localised strings](#localised-strings) on how the message deals with languages.
* name - *Object* *optional*. A list of human-readable localised *[names](#name)* for the transmission. See the section on [localised strings](#localised-strings) on how the message deals with languages.
* sender - *Object*. *[Sender](#sender)* contains information about the party that is transmitting the message.
* receivers - *Array* *optional* of *[Receiver](#receiver)* objects thats contain information about the party that is receiving the message. This can be useful if the WS requires authentication.
* links - *Array* *optional*. *Links* field is an array of *[link](#link)* objects. If appropriate, a collection of links to additional external resources for the header.

Example:

	"meta": {
		"schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-json/master/metadata-message/tools/schemas/sdmx-json-metadata-schema.json",

	}

#### annotation

*Object* *optional*. Provides all information about an annotation. 

* id - *String* *optional*. ID provides a non-standard identification of an annotation. It can be used to disambiguate annotations.
* title - *String* *optional*. Provides a non-localised title for the annotation.
* type - *String* *optional*. Type is used to distinguish between annotations designed to support various uses. The types are not enumerated, and these can be freely specified by the creator of the annotations. The definitions and use of annotation types should be documented by their creator.

	}

#### link

See the section on [linking mechanism](#linking-mechanism) for all information on links.
Providing links allowing accessing the underlying SDMX Data Structure Definition, Dataflow
and/or Provision Agreements is recommended.

#### report

* annotations - *Array* *optional*. *[Annotations](#annotation)* is a collection of indices of the corresponding *annotations* for the report.
* attributeSet - *Object*. *[AttributeSet](#attributeSet)* contains the reported metadata attribute values for the reported metadata.
* target - *Object*. Target contains a set of target reference values which when taken together, identify the object or objects to which the reported metadata apply.

Example:

	{
		"id": "REPORT1",
		"annotations": [
			{
			    # annotation object #
			}
		],
		"attributeSet": {
		    # attributeSet object #
		},
		"target": {
		    # target object #
		}
	}

##### attributeSet

*Object*. Contains a set of report attributes and identifies a target objects] to which they apply.
 
* reportedAttributes - Non-empty *Array* of *[reportedAttribute](#reportedAttribute)* objects which provide the details of a reported attribute, including a value and/or child reported attributes.

Example:

    {
		"reportedAttributes": [
			{
    		    # reportedAttribute object #
			}
		]
	}

##### reportedAttribute

*Object*. Defines the structure for a reported metadata attribute. A value for the attribute can be supplied as either a single value, or multi-lingual text values (either structured or unstructured). An optional set of child metadata attributes is also available if the metadata attribute definition defines nested metadata attributes.

* id - *String*. ID for the reported metadata attribute.
* value - *String* *optional*. Value for the reported metadata attribute.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. *[Annotations](#annotation)* is a collection of indices of the corresponding *annotations* for the reported metadata attribute.
* structuredTexts - *Object* *optional*. Human-readable localised *[names](#name)* of the text. StructuredTexts allows for mixed content of text and XHTML tags. When using this type, one will have to provide a reference to the XHTML schema, since the processing of the tags within this type is strict, meaning that they are validated against the XHTML schema provided.
* texts - *Object* *optional*. Human-readable localised *[names](#name)* of the text.
* attributeSet - *Object* *optional*. Recursive *[attributeSet](#attributeSet)* that contains the reported metadata attribute values for the child metadata attributes.

* id - *String*. ID for the target.
* referenceValues - Non-empty *Array* of *[referenceValue](#referenceValue)* objects which contain a value for a target reference object reference. When this is taken with its sibling elements, they identify the object or objects to which the reported metadata apply. The content of this will either be a reference to an identifiable object, a data key, a reference to a data set, or a report period.
 
Example:

    {
		"id": "TARGET1",
		"referenceValues": [
			{
    		    # referenceValue object #
			}
		]
	}

###### referenceValue

* id - *String*. ID for the reference value.
* constraintContent - *String* *optional*. ConstraintContent provides a URN reference to an attachment constraint for the purpose of reporting metadata against the data identified in the key sets and/or cube regions identified by the constraint. A constraint target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value.
* dataKey - *Object* *optional*. *[DataKey](#dataKey)* object. DataKey provides a set of dimension references and values for those dimension for the purpose of reporting metadata against a set of data. A key descriptor values target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value.
* dataSet - *Object* *optional*. *[dataSet reference](#dataSetReference)* object. DataSet provides a URN reference to a data set for the purpose of reporting metadata against the data. A data set target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value.
* object - *String* *optional*. Provides a URN reference to an identifiable object in the SDMX information model. An identifiable object target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value.
* reportPeriod - *String* *optional*. ReportPeriod provides a report period for the purpose of qualifying the target reporting period of reported metadata. A report period target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value.

Example:

	{
		"id": "$",
		"constraintContent": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.constraint.=ECB:ECB_EXR1(1.0)",
		"dataKey": {
   		    # dataKey object #
		},
		"dataSet": {
   		    # dataSet object #
		},
		"object": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.datastructure.DataStructure=ECB:ECB_EXR1(1.0)",
		"reportPeriod": "2018"
	}

####### dataKey

*Object*. DataKey is a region which defines a distinct full or partial data key. The key consists of a set of values, each referencing a dimension and providing a single value for that dimension. The purpose of the key is to define a subset of a data set (i.e. the observed value and data attribute) which have the dimension values provided in this definition. Any dimension not stated explicitly in this key is assumed to be wild carded, thus allowing for the definition of partial data keys.

* include - *Boolean* *optional*.
* keyValues - Non-empty *array* of *[dataKeyValue](#dataKeyValue)* objects.

Example:

	{
        "include": true,
		"keyValues": [
			{
				# dataKeyValue object #
			}
		]
	}

######## dataKeyValue

*Object*. DataKeyValue provides a dimension value for the purpose of defining a distinct data key. Only a single value can be provided for the dimension.

* id - *String*. 
* include - *Boolean* *optional*.
* value - *String*. 

Example:

	{
		"id": "EXR_TYPE",
        "include": true,
		"value": "NRP0"
	}

####### dataSetReference

*Object*. DataSetReference defines the structure of a reference to a data/metadata set. A full reference to a data provider and the identifier for the data set must be provided. Note that this is not derived from the base reference structure since data/metadata sets are not technically identifiable.

* dataProvider - *String*. DataProvider is a URN reference to a the provider of the data/metadata set. 
* id - *String*. ID contains the identifier of the data/metadata set being referenced. 

Example:

	{
		"dataProvider": "EXB",
		"id": "DATASET1"
	}

## error

*Object* *optional*. Used to provide a error message in addition to RESTful web services HTTP error status codes. The following pieces of information are to be provided:

* code - *Number*. Provides a code number for the error message. Code numbers are defined in the SDMX 2.1 Web Services Guidelines.
* title - *Object* *optional*. A list of short, human-readable localised summary (see *[names](#name)*) of the problem that SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of localization.
* detail - *Object* *optional*. A list of human-readable localised explanations (see *[names](#name)*) specific to this occurrence of the problem. Like title, this field’s value can be localized. It is fully customizable by the service providers and should provide enough detail to ease understanding the reasons of the error.
* links - *Array* *optional*. *Links* field is an array of *[link](#link)* objects. If appropriate, a collection of links to additional external resources for the error.

See the section on [localised strings](#localised-strings) on how the message deals with languages.

Example:

	{
		"code": 150,
		"title": { "en": "Invalid number of items in the item parameter" }
	}

# Linking mechanism

## link

*Object* *optional*. A link to an external resource.

* href - *String*. Absolute or relative URL of the external resource.
* rel - *String*. Relationship of the object to the external resource. See semantics below.
* urn - *String* *optional*. The urn holds a valid SDMX Registry URN (see SDMX Registry Specification for details).
* uri - *String* *optional*. The uri attribute holds a URI that contains a link to additional information about the resource, such as a web page. This uri is not an SDMX resource.
* title - *Object* *optional*. A list of human-readable localised descriptions (see *[names](#name)*) of the target link. See the section on [localised strings](#localised-strings) on how the message deals with languages.
* type - *String* *optional*. A hint about the type of representation returned by the link.
* hreflang - *String* *optional*. The natural language of the external link, the same as used in the HTTP Accept-Language request header.

Examples:

	{
		"href": "https://registry.sdmx.org/ws/rest/datastructure/ECB/ECB_EXR1",
		"rel": "self",
		"uri": "http://www.xyz.org/pdf/0123456789"
	}
    
	{
		"href": "https://registry.sdmx.org/ws/rest/dataflow/ECB.DISS/BSI_PUB/1.0",
		"rel": "dataflow",
		"urn": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.datastructure.dataflow=ECB.DISS:BSI_PUB(1.0)"
	}
    
	{
		"href": "https://registry.sdmx.org/FusionRegistry/ws/rest/provisionagreement/ESTAT/PA_NAMAIN_IDC_N",
		"rel": "provisionagreement"
	}

	{
		"href": "https://registry.sdmx.org/help.html",
		"rel": "help",
		"title": { "en": "Documentation about the SDMX Global Registry" },
		"type": "text/html",
		"hreflang": "en"
	}

Collections of links can be attached to various elements in SDMX-JSON.

Similarily with standards such as HTML5 and Atom, link elements in SDMX-JSON *must* define a *URL* (the `href` attribute) and a *semantic* (the `rel` attribute). This allows clients to follow the links they care about and ignore the ones whose semantic they are not interested in. In addition, links in SDMX-JSON *may* define a `title` (a human-friendly description of the target link) and a `type` (a hint about the type of representation returned by the link). Please refer to the [list of Media Types and Subtypes](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) assigned and listed by the IANA for additional information about expected values for the `type` attribute.

SDMX-JSON offers a list of predefined semantics, but implementers are free to extend it. The list of predefined semantics comes from the list of SDMX artefacts that can be returned by SDMX RESTful web services, semantics defined in [RFC5988](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5988.txt) and additional items deemed to be useful in the context of statistical data dissemination. These semantics are:

  - SDMX artefacts: dataStructure, metadataStructure, categoryScheme, conceptScheme, codelist, hierarchicalCodelist, organisationScheme, agencyScheme, dataProviderScheme, dataConsumerScheme, organisationUnitScheme, dataflow, metadataflow, reportingTaxonomy, provisionAgreement, structureSet, process, categorisation, contentconstraint, attachmentconstraint, category, concept, code, organisation, agency, dataProvider, dataConsumer, organisationUnit, reportingCategory, Data
  - RFC5988: alternate, copyright, glossary, help, index.
  - Miscellaneous: calendar (link to a release calendar), source (information about the source of data), request (the SDMX RESTful query that triggered the SDMX-JSON response).

The *URL* captured in the `href` attribute can be *absolute* or *relative*. **It is recommended to use absolute URLs in case the SDMX-JSON message is archived.**

# Localised strings

At least all language matches according to the user’s preferred language choices in the http Accept-Language header (or if that is not available than according to the system's default languages) are to be provided for each localisable message element.
In case that there is no such language match for a particular localisable element, it is optional to:

- return the element in the system-default languages or alternatively to not return the element
- indicate available alternative languages for the element's maintainable artefact through links to underlying localised resources

**It is recommended to indicate all languages used anywhere in the message for localised elements through http Content-Language response header (languages of the intended audience) and/or through a “content-language” property in the meta tag.** The main language used can be indicated through the “lang” property in the meta tag.


# Security Considerations

This document defines a response format for SDMX RESTful Web Services in JSON
and it raises no new security considerations. SDMX Web Services Guidelines
includes the security considerations associated with its usage.


# Extending SDMX-JSON

The objects defined in SDMX-JSON are "open", i.e. they can be extended with properties not defined in this specification. Providers of SDMX-JSON messages are therefore welcome to add support for features not covered in this specification. Whenever appropriate, providers who opt to do so are invited to inform us, so that future versions of SDMX-JSON may integrate these extensions, thereby improving interoperability.

The snippet below shows an example of an `error` object, extended with a `wsCustomErrorCode`:

	```
	"errors": [
		{
			"code": 150,
			"title": { "en": "Invalid number of items in the item parameter" }
			"wsCustomErrorCode": 39272
		}
	]
	```
