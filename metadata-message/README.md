# SDMX-JSON Metadata Message

As one of the standard SDMX metadata exchange formats, SDMX-JSON Metadata Message is 
a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) based referential metadata exchange message format 
designed for and therefore responding to the main use case of data discovery 
and visualisation on the web.

JSON is a widely used standardised lightweight data-interchange format. 
SDMX-JSON with a simple and dense but generic message format that supports 
different types of data structures will ease writing software for the web 
that easily consumes SDMX resources. The format may be used in a wide variety of 
programming languages and application programs. Testing and development of the 
format has focused on JavaScript applications running in web browsers. 

The current SDMX-JSON Metadata Message format 2.0.0 supports the SDMX 3.0 Information Model 
and works together with the SDMX 3.0 RESTful Web Services API for referential metadata queries.
