# SDMX-JSON Structure Message

SDMX-JSON Structure Message is an SDMX data exchange format based on JSON. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used standardised lightweight data-interchange format.
SDMX-JSON Structure Message focuses on data discovery, works together with the SDMX RESTful Web Services API and it supports all features of that API for structure queries.

The current SDMX-JSON Structure Message format 2.0.1 supports the SDMX 3.0 Information Model and works together with the SDMX 3.0 RESTful Web Services API for structure queries for various types of visualisations. It adheres to the HATEOAS principles. Queries can ask for specific structural SDMX artefacts, and to include related structural SDMX artefacts.
