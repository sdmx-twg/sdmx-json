# SDMX-JSON Structure Message

SDMX-JSON Structure Message is an SDMX data exchange format based on JSON. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used standardised lightweight data-interchange format.
SDMX-JSON Structure Message works together with the SDMX RESTful Web Services API. Structure Message focuses on data discovery and it supports all features of the SDMX RESTful API for structure queries.

The proposed format conforms to the JSON standard specification, and it supports the SDMX 2.1 Information Model and the full functionality of the SDMX 2.1 RESTful API for structure queries for various types of visualisations. It adheres to the HATEOAS principles. Queries can ask for specific structural SDMX artefacts, and to include related structural SDMX artefacts.
