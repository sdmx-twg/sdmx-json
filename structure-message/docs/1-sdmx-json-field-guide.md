# Introduction to SDMX-JSON Structure Message

See the SDMX-JSON Data Message docs for a brief introduction of the SDMX information model. For additional information on the SDMX information model, please refer to the [SDMX documentation](http://sdmx.org/?page_id=10).

Samples, tools and other SDMX-JSON resources are available in the public Github repository <https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-json>.

Before we start, let's clarify a few more things about this guide:

- New fields may be introduced in later versions. Therefore consuming applications should tolerate the addition of new fields with ease.
- The ordering of properties in objects is undefined. The properties may appear in any order and consuming applications should not rely on any specific ordering. It is safe to consider a nulled property and the absence of a property as the same thing.
- Not all properties appear in all contexts. For example response with error messages may not contain a data property.

# Field Guide to SDMX-JSON Structure Message Objects

## message

Message is the top level object and it contains the requested information ("data") as well as the meta-information decribing the (technical) context of the message and, possibly, error information.

* meta - *Object* *optional*. A *[meta](#meta)* object that contains non-standard meta-information and basic technical information about the message, such as when it was prepared and who has sent it.
* data - *Object* *optional*. *[Data](#data)* contains the message's “primary data”.
* errors - *Array* *optional*. *Errors* field is an array of *[error](#error)* objects. When appropriate provides a list of error messages in addition to RESTful web services HTTP error status codes.

The members data and errors MUST NOT coexist in the same message.

Example:

	{
		"meta": {
			# meta object #
		},
		"data": {
			# data object #
		},
		"errors": [
			{
				# error object #
			}
		]
	}

## meta

*Object* *optional*. Used to include non-standard meta-information and basic technical information 
about the message, such as when it was prepared and who has sent it.
Any members MAY be specified within `meta` objects.
* schema - *String* *optional*. Contains the URL to the schema allowing to validate the message. This also allows identifying the version of SDMX-JSON format used in this message. **Providing the link to the SDMX-JSON schema is recommended.**
* id - *String*. Unique string that identifies the message for further references.
* test - *Boolean* *optional*. Indicates whether the message is for test purposes or not. False for normal messages.
* prepared - *String*. A timestamp indicating when the message was prepared. Values must follow the ISO 8601 syntax for combined dates and times, including time zone.
* contentLanguages - *Array* *optional*. Array of strings containing the identifyer of all languages used anywhere in the message for localized elements, and thus the languages of the intended audience, representaing in an array format the same information than the http Content-Language response header, e.g. "en, fr-fr". See IETF Language Tags: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1. The array's first element indicates the main language used in the message for localized elements. **The usage of this property is recommended.**
* name - *String* *optional*. Human-readable (best-language-match) name for the transmission.
* names - *Object* *optional*. Human-readable localised *[names](#names)* for the transmission.
* sender - *Object*. *[Sender](#sender)* contains information about the party that is transmitting the message.
* receiver - *Object* *optional*. *[Receiver](#receiver)* contains information about the party that is receiving the message. This can be useful if the WS requires authentication.
* links - *Array* *optional*. *Links* field is an array of *[link](#link)* objects. If appropriate, a collection of links to additional external resources for the header.

See the section on [localised text elements](#localised-text-elements) on how the message deals with languages.

### Common properties of SDMX artefacts of base type "ItemScheme"

All SDMX artefacts of base type "ItemScheme" (CategoryScheme, ConceptScheme, Codelist, AgencyScheme, DataProviderScheme, DataConsumerScheme, OrganisationUnitScheme and ReportingTaxonomy) share the *[Common SDMX artefact properties](#common-sdmx-artefact-properties)*.

In addition, they share the following common object properties:

* isPartial - *Boolean* *optional*. If set to true, it indicates that the resource contains only a sub-set of items.
* categories/concepts/codes/agencies/dataProviders/dataConsumers/organisationUnits/reportingCategories - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of *[items](#item)* if the resource inherits from the ItemScheme. **Note that the order of items is significant. In the use case of a submission of a partial list is is necessary to include preceding and succeeding items to allow determining the correct positioniong of the submitted items.**

Example:

	{
		"id": "MY_DOMAINS",
		"isPartial": false,
		"categories": [
			{
				# item object #
			}
		]
	}

#### item

*Object* *optional*. Item within the ItemScheme (if the resource is a CategoryScheme, ConceptScheme, Codelist, AgencyScheme, DataProviderScheme, DataConsumerScheme, OrganisationUnitScheme and ReportingTaxonomy). 

* id - *String*. Identifier for the item.
* name - *String* *optional*. Human-readable (best-language-match) name of the item.
* names - *Object* *optional*. Human-readable localised *[names](#names)* of the item.
* description - *String* *optional*. Human-readable (best-language-match) description of the item. The description is typically longer than the text provided for the name field.
* descriptions - *Object* *optional*. Human-readable localised descriptions (see *[names](#names)*) of the item. A descriptions is typically longer than the text provided for the name field.
* start, end - *String* *optional*. Start and end are instances of time that define the actual Gregorian calendar period covered by the values for the time dimension. The algorithm for computing start and end fields for any supported reporting period is defined in the SDMX Technical Notes. These fields should be used only when the component value represents one of the values for the time dimension. Values are considered as inclusive both for the start field and the end field. Values must follow the ISO 8601 syntax for combined dates and times, including time zone. These fields are useful for visualisation tools, when selecting the appropriate point in time for the time axis. Statistical data, can be collected, for example, at the beginning, the middle or the end of the period, or can represent the average of observations through the period. Based on this information and using the start and end fields, it is easy to get or calculate the desired point in time to be used for the time axis.
* parent - *String* *optional*. Contains the ID or the URN for the parent of the item (which is itself an item) enabling the reconstruction of the ordered item hierarchy.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources for the item. See the section [link](#link).
* categories/concepts/codes/agencies/dataProviders/dataConsumers/organisationUnits/reportingCategories - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of child items of the item. **Note that the order of items is significant. In the use case of a submission of a partial list is is necessary to include preceding and succeeding items to allow determining the correct positioniong of the submitted items.**

See the section on [localised text elements](#localised-text-elements) on how the message deals with languages.

		"start": "2010-01-01T00:00Z",
		"end": "2010-12-31T23:59:59Z",
	}

### dataStructure

*Object*. Describes the structure of a data structure definition. A data structure definition is defined as a collection of metadata concepts, their structure and usage when used to collect or disseminate data.

See *[Common SDMX artefact properties](#common-sdmx-artefact-properties)*.

* dataStructureComponents - *Object* *optional*. The *[dataStructureComponents](#dataStructureComponents)* object defines the grouping of the sets of structural metadata concepts that have a defined structural role in the data structure definition, like dimensions, measure dimension, time dimension, primary measure and attributes. Note that for any component or group defined in a data structure definition, its id must be unique. This applies to the identifiers explicitly defined by the components as well as those inherited from the concept identity of a component. For example, if two dimensions take their identity from concepts with same identity (regardless of whether the concepts exist in different schemes) one of the dimensions must be provided a different explicit identifier. Although there are XML schema constraints to help enforce this, these only apply to explicitly assigned identifiers. Identifiers inherited from a concept from which a component takes its identity cannot be validated against this constraint. Therefore, systems processing data structure definitions will have to perform this check outside of the XML validation. There are also three reserved identifiers in a data structure definition; OBS_VALUE, TIME_PERIOD, and REPORTING_PERIOD_START_DAY. These identifiers may not be used outside of their respective defintions (PrimaryMeasure, TimeDimension, and ReportingYearStartDay). This applies to both the explicit identifiers that can be assigned to the components or groups as well as an identifier inherited by a component from its concept identity. For example, if an ordinary dimension (i.e. not the time dimension) takes its concept identity from a concept with the identifier TIME_PERIOD, that dimension must provide a different explicit identifier.

Example:

	{
		"id": "DSD1",
		"version": "1.0",
		"agencyID": "SDMX",
		"dataStructureComponents": {
			# dataStructureComponents object #
		}
	}

#### dataStructureComponents

*Object* *optional*. DataStructureComponents describes the structure of the grouping to the sets of metadata concepts that have a defined structural role in the data structure definition. At a minimum at least one dimension and a primary measure must be defined.

* attributeList - *Object* *optional*. The *[attributeList](#attributeList)* object is a collection of metadata concepts that define the attributes of the data structure definition. 
* dimensionList - *Object* *optional*. The *[dimensionList](#dimensionList)* object is an ordered set of structural metadata concepts that, combined, classify a statistical series, such as a time series, and whose values, when combined (the key) in an instance such as a data set, uniquely identify a specific series.
* groups - *Array* *optional*. Array of *[group](#group)* objects that are sets of structural metadata concepts (and possibly their values) that define a partial key derived from the key descriptor in a data structure definition. 
* measureList - *Object* *optional*. The *[measureList](#measureList)* object contains a single metadata concepts that define the primary measures of a data structure. 

Example:

	{
		"attributeList": {
			# attributeList object #
		},
		"dimensionList": {
			# dimensionList object #
		},
		"groups": [
			{
				# group object #
			}
		],
		"measureList": {
			# measureList object #
		}
	}

#### attributeList

*Object* *optional*. AttributeList describes the attributes in the data structure definition.

* id - *String*. Identifier for the attributeList.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* attributes - *Array* *optional*. The *[attribute](#attribute)* object describes the definition of a data attribute, which is defined as a characteristic of an object or entity.
* reportingYearStartDays - *Array* *optional*. The *[reportingYearStartDay](#reportingYearStartDay)* object is a specialized data attribute which provides important context to the time dimension. If the value of the time dimension is one of the standard reporting periods (see common:ReportingTimePeriodType) then this attribute is used to state the month and day that the reporting year begins. This provides a reference point from which the actual calendar dates covered by these periods can be determined. If this attribute does not occur in a data set, then the reporting year start day will be assumed to be January 1.

Example: 

	{
		"id": "AttributeDescriptor",
		"attributes": [
			{
				# attribute object #
			}
		],
		"reportingYearStartDays": [
			{
				# reportingYearStartDay object #
			}
		]
	}
					
##### attribute

*Object* *optional*. Attribute describes the structure of a data attribute, which is defined as a characteristic of an object or entity. The attribute takes its semantic, and in some cases it representation, from its concept identity. An attribute can be coded by referencing a code list from its coded local representation. It can also specify its text format, which is used as the representation of the attribute if a coded representation is not defined. Neither the coded or uncoded representation are necessary, since the attribute may take these from the referenced concept. An attribute specifies its relationship with other data structure components and is given an assignment status. These two properties dictate where in a data message the attribute will be attached, and whether or not the attribute will be required to be given a value. A set of roles defined in concept scheme can be assigned to the attribute.

* id - *String* *optional*. Identifier for the attribute.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* assignmentStatus - *String*. Indication whether reporting a given attribute is mandatory or conditional. The two possible values are "Mandatory" and "Conditional".
* attributeRelationship - *Object*. The *[attributeRelationship](#attributeRelationship)* object describes how the value of this attribute varies with the values of other components. These relationships will be used to determine the attachment level of the attribute in the various data formats. 				
* conceptIdentity - *String*. Urn reference to a concept where the identification of the concept scheme which defines it is contained in another context.
* conceptRoles - *Array* of *String*s *optional*. ConceptRole references (through URNs) the concepts which define roles which this attribute serves. If the concept from which the attribute takes its identity also defines a role the concept serves, then the isConceptRole indicator can be set to true on the concept identity rather than repeating the reference here.
* localRepresentation - *Object* *optional*. The *[localRepresentation](#localRepresentation)* object defines the representation for the attribute.				

Example:

	{
		"id": "OBS_STATUS",
		"assignmentStatus": "Mandatory",
		"attributeRelationship": {
			# attributeRelationship object #
		},
		"conceptIdentity": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.Concept=ECB:ECB_CONCEPTS(1.0).OBS_STATUS",
		"conceptRoles": [
			"urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.Concept=ECB:ECB_CONCEPTS(1.0).OBS_STATUS"
		],
		"localRepresentation": {
			# localRepresentation object #
		}
	}

###### attributeRelationship

*Object* *optional*. AttributeRelationship defines the structure for stating the relationship between an attribute and other data structure definition components.

* attachmentGroups - *Array* of *String*s *optional*. One or more identifiers of (a) local GroupKey Descriptor(s). This is used to specify that the attribute should always be attached to the groups referenced here. Note that if one of the referenced dimensions is the time dimension, the groups referenced here will be ignored.
* dimensions - *Array* of *String*s *optional*. One or more identifiers of (a) local dimension(s). This is used to reference dimensions in the data structure definition on which the value of this attribute depends. An attribute using this relationship can be either a group, series (or section), or observation level attribute. The attachment level of the attribute will be determined by the data format and which dimensions are referenced.
* group - *String* *optional*. Identifier of a local GroupKey Descriptor. This is used as a convenience to referencing all of the dimension defined by the referenced group. The attribute will also be attached to this group.
* none - Empty *Object* *optional*. This means that value of the attribute will not vary with any of the other data structure components. This will always be treated as a data set level attribute.
* primaryMeasure - *String* *optional*. Identifier of the local primary measure, where the reference to the data structure definition which defines the primary measure is provided in another context (for example the data structure definition in which the reference occurs). This is used to specify that the value of the attribute is dependent upon the observed value. An attribute with this relationship will always be treated as an observation level attribute.

Examples:

	{
		"attachmentGroups": [
			"MY_GROUP"
		]
	}

	{
		"dimensions": [
			"FREQ", "CURRENCY"
		]
	}

	{
		"group": "MY_GROUP"
	}

	{
		"none": {}
	}

	{
		"primaryMeasure": "OBS_VALUE"
	}

###### localRepresentation

*Object* *optional*. LocalRepresentation defines the representation for the attribute.

* enumeration - *String* *optional*. Urn reference to a codelist.
* enumerationFormat - *Object* *optional*. Urn reference to a codelist. The *[enumerationFormat](#enumerationformat)* object defines a restricted version of a text format that only allows facets and text types applicable to codes. Although the time facets permit any value, an actual code identifier does not support the necessary characters for time. Therefore these facets should not contain time in their values.
* textFormat - *Object* *optional*. The *[textFormat](#textFormat)* object defines the information for describing a range of text formats restricted to the representations allowed for all components except for target objects, and that does not allow for multi-lingual values.

Examples:

	{
		"enumeration": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.codelist.Codelist=ECB:CL_ORGANISATION(1.0)",
		"enumerationFormat": {
			# enumerationFormat object #
		}
	}

	{
		"textFormat": {
			# textFormat object #
		}
	}

Allowed is only one of the following string values: String, Alpha, AlphaNumeric, Numeric, BigInteger, Integer, Long, Short, Boolean, URI, Count, InclusiveValueRange, ExclusiveValueRange, Incremental, ObservationalTimePeriod, StandardTimePeriod, BasicTimePeriod, GregorianTimePeriod, GregorianYear, GregorianYearMonth, GregorianDay, ReportingTimePeriod, ReportingYear, ReportingSemester, ReportingTrimester, ReportingQuarter, ReportingMonth, ReportingWeek, ReportingDay, Month, MonthDay, Day, Duration
* timeInterval - *String* *optional*. A valid time duration.

Example:

	{
		textType: "String",
		maxLength: 1050
	}

##### reportingYearStartDay

*Object* *optional*. ReportingYearStartDay defines the structure of the reporting year start day attribute. The reporting year start day attribute takes its semantic from its concept identity (usually the REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY concept), yet is always has a fixed identifier (REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY). The reporting year start day attribute always has a fixed text format, which specifies that the format of its value is always a day and month in the ISO 8601 format of '--MM-DD'. As with any other attribute, an attribute relationship must be specified. this relationship should be carefully selected as it will determin what type of data the data structure definition will allow. For example, if an attribute relationship of none is specified, this will mean the data sets conforming to this data structure definition can only contain data with standard reporting periods where the all reporting periods have the same start day. In this case, data reported as standard reporting periods from two entities with different fiscal year start days could not be contained in the same data set.

* id - *String* *optional*. Identifier for the reportingYearStartDay data attribute.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* assignmentStatus - *String*. Indication whether reporting a given attribute is mandatory or conditional. The two possible values are "Mandatory" and "Conditional".
* attributeRelationship - *Object*. The *[attributeRelationship](#attributeRelationship)* object describes how the value of this attribute varies with the values of other components. These relationships will be used to determine the attachment level of the attribute in the various data formats. 				
* conceptIdentity - *String*. Urn reference to a concept where the identification of the concept scheme which defines it is contained in another context.
* localRepresentation - *Object* *optional*. The *[ReportingYearStartDayRepresentation](#ReportingYearStartDayRepresentation)* object defines the representation for the reporting year start day attribute. Enumerated values are not allowed and the text format is fixed to be a day and month in the ISO 8601 format of '--MM-DD'.  		

Example:

	{
		"id": "FISCALYEAR",
		"assignmentStatus": "Mandatory",
		"attributeRelationship": {
			# attributeRelationship object #
		},
		"conceptIdentity": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.Concept=ECB:ECB_CONCEPTS(1.0).FISCALYEAR",
		"localRepresentation": {
			# ReportingYearStartDayRepresentation object #
		}
	}

##### ReportingYearStartDayRepresentation

*Object* *optional*. ReportingYearStartDayRepresentation defines the representation for the reporting year start day attribute. Enumerated values are not allowed and the text format is fixed to be a day and month in the ISO 8601 format of '--MM-DD'.

* textFormat - *Object*. The *textFormat* object has only one single property *textType* fixed to "MonthDay". This type exists solely for the purpose of fixing the representation of the reporting year start day attribute.

Example:

	{
		"textFormat": {
			"textType": "MonthDay"
		}
	}

#### dimensionList

*Object* *optional*. DimensionList describes the key descriptor for a data structure definition. The order of the declaration of child dimensions is significant: it is used to describe the order in which they will appear in data formats for which key values are supplied in an ordered fashion (exclusive of the time dimension, which is not represented as a member of the ordered key). Any data structure definition which uses the time dimension should also declare a frequency dimension, conventionally the first dimension in the key (the set of ordered non-time dimensions). If is not necessary to assign a time dimension, as data can be organised in any fashion required.

* id - *String*. Identifier for the attributeList.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* dimensions - *Array* *optional*. The *[dimension](#dimension)* object describes the structure of a dimension, which is defined as a statistical concept used (most probably together with other statistical concepts) to identify a statistical series, such as a time series, e.g. a statistical concept indicating certain economic activity or a geographical reference area.
* measureDimensions - *Array* *optional*. The *[measureDimension](#measureDimension)* object describes a special type of dimension which defines multiple measures in a data structure. This is represented as any other dimension unless it is the observation dimension. It takes its representation from a concept scheme, and this scheme defines the measures and their representations. When data is formatted with this as the observation dimension, these measures can be made explicit or the value of the dimension can be treated as any other dimension. If the measures are explicit, the representation of the observation will be specific to the core representation for each concept in the representation concept scheme. Note that it is necessary that these representations are compliant (the same or derived from) with that of the primary measure.
* timeDimensions - *Array* *optional*. The *[timeDimension](#timeDimension)* object describes a special dimension which designates the period in time in which the data identified by the full series key applies..

Example:

	{
		"id": "DimensionDescriptor",
		"dimensions": [
			{
				# dimension object #
			}
		],
		"measureDimensions": [
			{
				# measureDimension object #
			}
		],
		"timeDimensions": [
			{
				# timeDimension object #
			}
		],
	}

##### dimension

*Object* *optional*. Dimension describes the structure of an ordinary dimension, which is defined as a statistical concept used (most probably together with other statistical concepts) to identify a statistical series, such as a time series, e.g. a statistical concept indicating certain economic activity or a geographical reference area. The dimension takes its semantic, and in some cases it representation, from its concept identity. A dimension can be coded by referencing a code list from its coded local representation. It can also specify its text format, which is used as the representation of the dimension if a coded representation is not defined. Neither the coded or uncoded representation are necessary, since the dimension may take these from the referenced concept.

* id - *String* *optional*. Identifier for the dimension.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* position - *Integer* *optional*. Positive integer (minimum: 0). The position attribute specifies the position of the dimension in the data structure definition, starting at 0. It is optional as the position of the dimension in the key descriptor (dimensionList object) always takes precedence over the value supplied here. This is strictly for informational purposes only.
* type - *String* *optional*. The type attribute identifies whether the dimension is a measure dimension, the time dimension, or a regular dimension. Although these are all apparent by the element names, this attribute allows for each dimension to be processed independent of its element as well as maintaining the restriction of only one measure and time dimension while still allowing dimension to occur in any order. The only possible values are: Dimension, MeasureDimension, TimeDimension.
* conceptIdentity - *String*. Urn reference to a concept where the identification of the concept scheme which defines it is contained in another context.
* conceptRoles - *Array* of *String*s *optional*. ConceptRole references concepts (through URNs) which define roles which this dimension serves. If the concept from which the dimension takes its identity also defines a role the concept serves, then the isConceptRole indicator can be set to true on the concept identity rather than repeating the reference here.
* localRepresentation - *Object* *optional*. The *[localRepresentation](#localRepresentation)* object defines the representation for the dimension.

Example:

	{
		"id": "FREQ",
		"position": 0,
		"type": "Dimension",
		"conceptIdentity": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.Concept=ECB:ECB_CONCEPTS(1.0).FREQ",
		"conceptRoles": [
			"urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.Concept=ECB:ECB_CONCEPTS(1.0).FREQ"
		],
		"localRepresentation": {
			# localRepresentation object #
		}
	}

##### measureDimension

*Object* *optional*. MeasureDimension defines the structure of the measure dimension. It is derived from the base dimension structure, but requires that a coded representation taken from a concept scheme is given.

* id - *String* *optional*. Identifier for the measure dimension.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* position - *Integer* *optional*. Positive integer (minimum: 0). The position attribute specifies the position of the dimension in the data structure definition, starting at 0. It is optional as the position of the dimension in the key descriptor (DimensionList element) always takes precedence over the value supplied here. This is strictly for informational purposes only.
* type - *String* *optional*. The type attribute identifies whether the dimension is a measure dimension, the time dimension, or a regular dimension. Although these are all apparent by the element names, this attribute allows for each dimension to be processed independent of its element as well as maintaining the restriction of only one measure and time dimension while still allowing dimension to occur in any order. The only possible values are: Dimension, MeasureDimension, TimeDimension.
* conceptIdentity - *String*. Urn reference to a concept where the identification of the concept scheme which defines it is contained in another context.
* conceptRoles - *Array* of *String*s *optional*. ConceptRole references concepts (through URNs) which define roles which this dimension serves. If the concept from which the dimension takes its identity also defines a role the concept serves, then the isConceptRole indicator can be set to true on the concept identity rather than repeating the reference here.
* localRepresentation - *Object*. The *measureDimension localRepresentation* object has only one required property *enumeration* which has to provide the URN reference to a concept scheme object.

Example:

	{
		"id": "MEASURE",
		"position": 5,
		"type": "MeasureDimension",
		"conceptIdentity": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.Concept=ECB:ECB_CONCEPTS(1.0).MEASURE",
		"conceptRoles": [
			"urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.Concept=ECB:ECB_CONCEPTS(1.0).MEASURE"
		],
		"localRepresentation": {
			"enumeration": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.ConceptScheme=ECB:ECB_MEASURES(1.0)"
		}

##### timeDimension

*Object* *optional*. TimeDimension describes the structure of a time dimension. The time dimension takes its semantic from its concept identity (usually the TIME_PERIOD concept), yet is always has a fixed identifier (TIME_PERIOD). The time dimension always has a fixed text format, which specifies that its format is always the in the value set of the observational time period (see common:ObservationalTimePeriodType). It is possible that the format may be a sub-set of the observational time period value set. For example, it is possible to state that the representation might always be a calendar year. See the enumerations of the textType attribute in the LocalRepresentation/TextFormat for more details of the possible sub-sets. It is also possible to facet this representation with start and end dates. The purpose of such facts is to restrict the value of the time dimension to occur within the specified range. If the time dimension is expected to allow for the standard reporting periods (see common:ReportingTimePeriodType) to be used, then it is strongly recommended that the reporting year start day attribute also be included in the data structure definition. When the reporting year start day attribute is used, any standard reporting period values will be assumed to be based on the start day contained in this attribute. If the reporting year start day attribute is not included and standard reporting periods are used, these values will be assumed to be based on a reporting year which begins January 1.

* id - *String* *optional*. Identifier for the time dimension.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* position - *Integer* *optional*. Positive integer (minimum: 0). The position attribute specifies the position of the dimension in the data structure definition, starting at 0. It is optional as the position of the dimension in the key descriptor (DimensionList element) always takes precedence over the value supplied here. This is strictly for informational purposes only.
* type - *String* *optional*. The type attribute identifies whether the dimension is a measure dimension, the time dimension, or a regular dimension. Although these are all apparent by the element names, this attribute allows for each dimension to be processed independent of its element as well as maintaining the restriction of only one measure and time dimension while still allowing dimension to occur in any order. The only possible values are: Dimension, MeasureDimension, TimeDimension.
* conceptIdentity - *String*. Urn reference to a concept where the identification of the concept scheme which defines it is contained in another context.
* localRepresentation - *Object*. The *localRepresentation* object has only one required property *[textFormat](#timeDimensionTextFormat)* which defines the representation for the time dimension.

Example:

	{
		"id": "TIME_PERIOD",
		"position": 6,
		"type": "TimeDimension",
		"conceptIdentity": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.Concept=ECB:ECB_CONCEPTS(1.0).TIME_PERIOD",
		"localRepresentation": {
			"textFormat": {
				# timeDimension textFormat object #
			}
		}
	}

##### timeDimensionTextFormat

*Object* *optional*. The timeDimension textFormat only allows time based format and specifies a default ObservationalTimePeriod representation and facets of a start and end time.

* endTime - *String* *optional*. End time for the time dimension.
* startTime - *String* *optional*. Start time for the time dimension.
* textType - *String* *optional*. Any of the following values: ObservationalTimePeriod, StandardTimePeriod, BasicTimePeriod, GregorianTimePeriod, GregorianYear, GregorianYearMonth, GregorianDay, ReportingTimePeriod, ReportingYear, ReportingSemester, ReportingTrimester, ReportingQuarter, ReportingMonth, ReportingWeek, ReportingDay, DateTime, TimeRange.

Example:

	{
		"endTime": "2050",
		"startTime": "1960",
		"textType": "ObservationalTimePeriod"
	}

#### group

*Object* *optional*. Group describes the structure of a group descriptor in a data structure definition. A group may consist of a of partial key, or collection of distinct cube regions or key sets to which attributes may be attached. The purpose of a group is to specify attributes values which have the same value based on some common dimensionality. All groups declared in the data structure must be unique - that is, you may not have duplicate partial keys. All groups must be given unique identifiers.

* id - *String*. Identifier for the group.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* attachmentConstraint - *String* *optional*. URN reference to an attachment constraint that defines the key sets and/or cube regions that attributes may be attached to. This is an alternative to referencing the dimensions, and allows attributes to be attached to data for given values of dimensions.
* groupDimensions - *Array* *optional*. Each of the *groupDimension* objects contains only a reference to a dimension in the key descriptor (DimensionList) through its single property *dimensionReference*. Although it is conventional to declare dimensions in the same order as they are declared in the ordered key, there is no requirement to do so - the ordering of the values of the key are taken from the order in which the dimensions are declared. Note that the id of a dimension may be inherited from its underlying concept - therefore this reference value may actually be the id of the concept.

Examples:

	{
		"id": "GROUP1",
		"attachmentConstraint": "ATTACHMENTCONSTRAINT"
	}

	{
		"id": "GROUP1",
		"groupDimensions": [
			{
				"dimensionReference": "CURRENCY"
			},
			{
				"dimensionReference": "CURRENCY_DENOM"
			}
		]
	}

#### measureList

*Object* *optional*. MeasureList describes the structure of the measure descriptor for a data structure definition. Only a primary may be defined.

* id - *String* *optional*. Identifier for the measureList.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* primaryMeasure - *Object*. The *[primaryMeasure](#primaryMeasure)* object defines the structure of the primary measure, which is the concept that is the value of the phenomenon to be measured in a data set. Although this may take its semantic from any concept, this is provided a fixed identifier (OBS_VALUE) so that it may be easily distinguished in data messages.

Example:

	{
		"id": "MEASURELIST",
		"primaryMeasure": {
			# primaryMeasure object #
		}
	}
		
#### primaryMeasure

*Object* *optional*. PrimaryMeasure describes the structure of the primary measure. It describes the observation values for all presentations of the data. The primary measure takes its semantic, and in some cases it representation, from its concept identity (conventionally the OBS_VALUE concept). The primary measure can be coded by referencing a code list from its coded local representation. It can also specify its text format, which is used as the representation of the primary measure if a coded representation is not defined. Neither the coded or uncoded representation are necessary, since the primary measure may take these from the referenced concept. Note that if the data structure declares a measure dimension, the representation of this must be a superset of all possible measure concept representations.

* id - *String* *optional*. Identifier for the measureList.
* annotations - *Array* *optional*. Provides a list of annotation objects. See the section [annotation](#annotation).
* links - *Array* *optional*. A collection of links to additional resources. See the section [link](#link).
* conceptIdentity - *String*. Urn reference to a concept where the identification of the concept scheme which defines it is contained in another context.
* localRepresentation - *Object* *optional*. The *[localRepresentation](#localRepresentation)* object defines the representation for the primaryMeasure.				

Example:

		"id": "OBS_VALUE",
		"conceptIdentity": "urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.conceptscheme.Concept=ECB:ECB_CONCEPTS(1.0).OBS_VALUE",
		"localRepresentation": {
			# localRepresentation object #
		}
	}

### metadataStructure

*Object*. Used to describe a metadata structure definition, which is defined as a collection of metadata concepts, their structure and usage when used to collect or disseminate reference metadata.

See *[Common SDMX artefact properties](#common-sdmx-artefact-properties)*.

See the schema file for more information.

### categoryScheme

*Object*. Describes the structure of a category scheme. A category scheme is the descriptive information for an arrangement or division of categories into groups based on characteristics, which the objects have in common. This provides for a simple, leveled hierarchy or categories.

See *[Common SDMX artefact properties](#common-sdmx-artefact-properties)*.
See *[common properties of SDMX artefacts of base type "ItemScheme"](#common-properties-of-sdmx-artefacts-of-base-type-itemscheme)*.
There are no additional parameters.
The start, end and parent properties are not used.

Example:

	{
		"id": "TOPICS",
		"version": "1.0",
		"agencyID": "SDMX",
		"name": "Topics",
		"names": {
			"en-GB-oed": "Topics",
			"fr": "Thèmes"
		},
		"isPartial": true,
		"categories": [
			{
				"id": "TOPIC1",

						"names": {
							"en-GB-oed": "Topic 11",
							"fr": "Thème 11"
						}
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}


### conceptScheme

*Object*. Describes the structure of a concept scheme. A concept scheme is the descriptive information for an arrangement or division of concepts into groups based on characteristics, which the objects have in common. It contains a collection of concept definitions, that may be arranged in simple hierarchies.

See *[Common SDMX artefact properties](#common-sdmx-artefact-properties)*.
See *[common properties of SDMX artefacts of base type "ItemScheme"](#common-properties-of-sdmx-artefacts-of-base-type-itemscheme)*.

In addition, `conceptScheme`'s *[item](#item)* artefacts share the following common object properties:

* coreRepresentation - *Object* *optional*. The *[coreRepresentation](#coreRepresentation)* object defines the core representation that are allowed for a concept. The text format allowed for a concept is that which is allowed for any non-target object component.
* isoConceptReference - *Object* *optional*. The *[isoConceptReference](#isoConceptReference)* object provides a reference to an ISO 11179 concept.
* parent - *String* *optional*. Urn reference to a local concept. Parent captures the semantic relationships between concepts which occur within a single concept scheme. This identifies the concept of which the current concept is a qualification (in the ISO 11179 sense) or subclass.
The start and end properties are not used.

Example:

	{
		"id": "CS_BOP",
		"name": "Balance of Payments Concept Scheme",
		"names": {
			"en": "Balance of Payments Concept Scheme",
			"fr": "Schéma des concepts de Balance des paiements"},
		"agencyId": "IMF",
		"version": "1.9",

				},
				"isoConceptReference": {
					# isoConceptReference object #
				}
			}
		]
	}

#### coreRepresentation

*Object* *optional*. A core representation for a concept. It is either a reference to a codelist which enumerates the possible values that can be used as the representation of this concept, or a text format.

* enumeration - *String* *optional*. Urn reference to a codelist which enumerates the possible values that can be used as the representation of this concept. This must be a valid SDMX Registry URN (see SDMX Registry Specification for details) of a codelist.
* id - *String* *optional*. Identifier for a codelist.
* agencyID - *String* *optional*. ID of the agency maintaining the codelist.
* version - *String* *optional*. Version of the codelist. It is "1.0" by default.
* enumerationFormat - *Object* *optional*. To be used only with a codelist reference. The *[enumerationFormat](#enumerationformat)* object defines a restricted version of a text format that only allows facets and text types applicable to codes. Although the time facets permit any value, an actual code identifier does not support the necessary characters for time. Therefore these facets should not contain time in their values.
* textFormat - *String* *optional*. As an exclusive alternative to a codelist reference. It defines the information for describing a full range of text formats and may place restrictions on the values of the other attributes, referred to as "facets". Allowed is only one of the following string values: String, Alpha, AlphaNumeric, Numeric, BigInteger, Integer, Long, Short, Decimal, Float, Double, Boolean, URI, Count, InclusiveValueRange, ExclusiveValueRange, Incremental, ObservationalTimePeriod, StandardTimePeriod, BasicTimePeriod, GregorianTimePeriod, GregorianYear, GregorianYearMonth, GregorianDay, ReportingTimePeriod, ReportingYear, ReportingSemester, ReportingTrimester, ReportingQuarter, ReportingMonth, ReportingWeek, ReportingDay, DateTime, TimeRange, Month, MonthDay, Day, Time, Duration, XHTML.

			# enumerationFormat object #
		}
	}

	{
		"textFormat": "String"
	}

##### enumerationFormat

*Object* *optional*. A restricted version of a text format that only allows facets and text types applicable to codes. Although the time facets permit any value, an actual code identifier does not support the necessary characters for time. Therefore these facets should not contain time in their values.

* textType *String* *optional*. One of the types: String, Alpha, AlphaNumeric, Numeric, BigInteger, Integer, Long, Short, Boolean, URI, Count, InclusiveValueRange, ExclusiveValueRange, Incremental, ObservationalTimePeriod, StandardTimePeriod, BasicTimePeriod, GregorianTimePeriod, GregorianYear, GregorianYearMonth, GregorianDay, ReportingTimePeriod, ReportingYear, ReportingSemester, ReportingTrimester, ReportingQuarter, ReportingMonth, ReportingWeek, ReportingDay, Month, MonthDay, Day, Duration.

#### isoConceptReference

*Object*. Provides a reference to an ISO 11179 concept.

* conceptAgency - *String*.
* conceptID - *String*.
* conceptSchemeID - *String*.

### codelist

*Object*. Defines the structure of a codelist. A codelist is defined as a list from which some statistical concepts (coded concepts) take their values.

See *[Common SDMX artefact properties](#common-sdmx-artefact-properties)*.
See *[common properties of SDMX artefacts of base type "ItemScheme"](#common-properties-of-sdmx-artefacts-of-base-type-itemscheme)*.

Note that the SDMX Information Model does not foresee an `codes` property for codelist items (`code`), hierarchies being expressed through the `parent` property for codelist items, which contains the ID of the parent code. However, for retrieval use cases, implementers can choose to resolve the parent-child relationships also into recursive `code` properties of `code`. A `code` describes the structure of a code. A code is defined as a language independent set of letters, numbers or symbols that represent a concept whose meaning is described in a natural language. Presentational information not present may be added through the use of annotations.

In addition, `codelist`'s *[item](#item)* artefacts share the following common object properties:

* parent - *String* *optional*. The ID of the parent code. Parent provides the ability to describe simple hierarchies within a single codelist, by referencing the ID value of another code in the same codelist.
The start and end properties are not used.

Example:

	{
		"id": "CODELIST1",
		"version": "1.0",
		"agencyID": "SDMX",
		"name": "Code list 1",
		"names": {
			"en": "Code list 1",
			"fr": "Liste de codes 1"
		},

				"name": "Code 11",
				"names": {
					"en": "Code 11",
					"fr": "Code 11"
				}
				"parent": "CODE1"
			}
		]
	}


### hierarchicalCodelist

*Object*. Describes the structure of a hierarchical codelist. A hierarchical code list is defined as an organised collection of codes that may participate in many parent/child relationships with other codes in the list, as defined by one or more hierarchy of the list.

See *[Common SDMX artefact properties](#common-sdmx-artefact-properties)*.

See the schema file for more information.

### agencyScheme

*Object*. Defines a specific type of organisation scheme which contains only maintenance agencies. The agency scheme maintained by a particular maintenance agency is always provided a fixed identifier and version, and is never final. Therefore, agencies can be added or removed without have to version the scheme. Agencies schemes have no hierarchy, meaning that no agency may define a relationship with another agency in the scheme. In fact, the actual parent agency for an agency in a scheme is the agency which defines the scheme.

See *[Common SDMX artefact properties](#common-sdmx-artefact-properties)*.
See *[common properties of SDMX artefacts of base type "ItemScheme"](#common-properties-of-sdmx-artefacts-of-base-type-itemscheme)*.

In addition, `agencyScheme`'s *[item](#item)* artefacts share the following common object properties:

* contacts - *Array* *optional*. A collection of *[contacts](#contact)*. Provides contact information for the agency. The contacts defined for the organisation are specific to the agency role the organisation is serving.

See the schema file for more information.

See the section on [localised text elements](#localised-text-elements) on how the message deals with languages.

Example:

	{
		"code": 150,
		"title": "Invalid number of items in the item parameter",
		"titles": {
			"en": "Invalid number of items in the item parameter",
			"fr": "Nombre invalide d'items dans le paramètre 'item'"
		}
	}

# Linking mechanism

## link

*Object* *optional*. A link to an external resource.

* href - *String*. Absolute or relative URL of the external resource.
* rel - *String*. Relationship of the object to the external resource. See semantics below.
* urn - *String* *optional*. The urn holds a valid SDMX Registry URN (see SDMX Registry Specification for details).
* uri - *String* *optional*. The uri attribute holds a URI that contains a link to additional information about the resource, such as a web page. This uri is not an SDMX resource.
* title - *String* *optional*. A human-readable (best-language-match) description of the target link.
* titles - *Object* *optional*. A list of human-readable localised descriptions (see *[names](#names)*) of the target link.
* type - *String* *optional*. A hint about the type of representation returned by the link.
* hreflang - *String* *optional*. The natural language of the external link, the same as used in the HTTP Accept-Language request header.

Collections of links can be attached to various elements in SDMX-JSON.

Similarily with standards such as HTML5 and Atom, link elements in SDMX-JSON *must* define a *URL* (the `href` attribute) and a *semantic* (the `rel` attribute). This allows clients to follow the links they care about and ignore the ones whose semantic they are not interested in. In addition, links in SDMX-JSON *may* define a `title` (a human-friendly description of the target link) and a `type` (a hint about the type of representation returned by the link). Please refer to the [list of Media Types and Subtypes](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) assigned and listed by the IANA for additional information about expected values for the `type` attribute.

SDMX-JSON offers a list of predefined semantics, but implementers are free to extend it. The list of predefined semantics comes from the list of SDMX artefacts that can be returned by SDMX RESTful web services, semantics defined in [RFC5988](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5988.txt) and additional items deemed to be useful in the context of statistical data dissemination. These semantics are:

  - SDMX artefacts: dataStructure, metadataStructure, categoryScheme, conceptScheme, codelist, hierarchicalCodelist, organisationScheme, agencyScheme, dataProviderScheme, dataConsumerScheme, organisationUnitScheme, dataflow, metadataflow, reportingTaxonomy, provisionAgreement, structureSet, process, categorisation, contentconstraint, attachmentconstraint, category, concept, code, organisation, agency, dataProvider, dataConsumer, organisationUnit, reportingCategory, Data
  - RFC5988: alternate, copyright, glossary, help, index.
  - Miscellaneous: calendar (link to a release calendar), source (information about the source of data), request (the SDMX RESTful query that triggered the SDMX-JSON response).

The *URL* captured in the `href` attribute can be *absolute* or *relative*. **It is recommended to use absolute URLs in case the SDMX-JSON message is archived.**

# Localised text elements

**Localised best-language-match text strings (static properties matched through "Lookup"):**

The first best language match according to the user’s preferred language choices expressed through the HTTP content negotiation (Accept-Language header parameter) is to be provided for each localised text element. The message does however not indicate the returned language per localised text element.

This language matching type is called "Lookup", see <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647#section-3.4>.

Example:

	"name": "Frequency"

**Localised text objects (variable properties matched through "Filtering"):**

All available language matches according to the user’s preferred language choices expressed through the HTTP content negotiation (Accept-Language header parameter) is to be provided for each localised text element. 

This language matching type is called "Filtering", see <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647#section-3.3>.

Example:

	"names": {
		"en": "Frequency",
		"fr": "Fréquence"
	}

The localised text object needs to be present whenever the related localised best-language-match text strings is present, and especially whenever a localised text is mandatory in the SDMX Information model. Note that localised text (and the knowledge about the locale) is mandatory in structure messages when artefacts are being submitted for storage to a registry or to other databases. The localised text object is important for use cases where multiple languages are required or where the information on the language used is required.


In case that there is no language match for a particular localisable element, it is optional to:

- return the element in a system-default language or alternatively to not return the element
- indicate available alternative languages for the element's maintainable artefact through links to underlying localised resources

**It is recommended to indicate all languages used anywhere in the message for localised elements through http Content-Language response header (languages of the intended audience) and/or through a “contentLanguages” property in the meta tag.** The main language used can be indicated through the “lang” property in the meta tag.


# Security Considerations

This document defines a response format for SDMX RESTful Web Services in JSON
and it raises no new security considerations. SDMX Web Services Guidelines
includes the security considerations associated with its usage.


# Extending SDMX-JSON

The objects defined in SDMX-JSON are "open", i.e. they can be extended with properties not defined in this specification. Providers of SDMX-JSON messages are therefore welcome to add support for features not covered in this specification. Whenever appropriate, providers who opt to do so are invited to inform us, so that future versions of SDMX-JSON may integrate these extensions, thereby improving interoperability.

The snippet below shows an example of an `error` object, extended with a `wsCustomErrorCode`:

	```
	"errors": [
		{
			"code": 150,
			"title": "Invalid number of items in the item parameter",
			"titles": {
				"en": "Invalid number of items in the item parameter",
				"fr": "Nombre invalide d'items dans le paramètre 'item'"
			}
			"wsCustomErrorCode": 39272
		}
	]
	```
